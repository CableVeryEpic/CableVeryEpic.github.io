        Hey there, welcome to my site. My name is Caleb Wittmer, and I am currently a student studying ICT at UTAS.
        <br><br>I made this site with html/css/js, and hopefully in the future with vue.
        <br><br>Check out my portfolio to see the projects I have completed in my free time and during university.
        <br><br>Check out my about page to learn more about me.
